# Reporting Issues

When a change needs to made to a software product, or you would like to request a feature, you must file a GitHub issue. This allows our team to see what is needed for our software, prioritize work, and keep people updated. By reporting issues yourself, you can take ownership of that part of the software development process and be updated on the status of the development around the issue. GitHub also gives us a nice interface for asking questions, having discussions and assigning work all within a single application. __No work will be done on a software product unless there is a GitHub issue for the work to be done.__ This allows us the team to stay organized, prioritize, and measure our output. It also encourages reporters to clearly type out their thoughts in a way that is concise and filled with useful information.

## How to submit an issue

There is an issues board on GitHub for each piece of software developed. Each board has a form to submit a new issue. To determine exactly which board to go to to report an issue, contact a member of the development team.

## Reporting a bug

Bugs are given the highest priority when tasks are organized and scheduled during the development team's weekly meetings. They keep our software working as expected, and keep our developers disciplined.

### What to report

 - Unexpected result from a behavior 
```   
When I click "Add to Cart", I expect to see an item in my cart. Instead, there is nothing in my cart which is unexpected
```
 - Broken links
 - 500 or Internal Server Errors
 - Unnatural formatting or design on a mobile device or computer

### Helpful tips for reporting a bug


 - Include steps to reproduce the issue. Assume the person reading the issue has no prior knowledge about the problem. 
```
1. First visit a product that has a price under $10
2. Then click "Add to Cart"
3. Refresh the page
```
 - Describe a behavior that is expected, and what actually happened
 > I expect to see items in my cart, but there are none.
 - Include URLs where relevant.
 - Give exact times when you've experienced errors. The team can try to find the issue in the error logs.
 - Don't use opinionated language. "This sucks" or "isn't good" doesn't help solve the problem and just distracts the person trying to solve your issue

### Critical Bugs

Most bugs are scheduled after the next task management meeting. However, some issues require urgent attention and are known as a critical bug. If you feel your issue is critical, contact a member of the development team directly using Slack or email and send them a link to the issue.

#### What qualifies as a critical bug
 - An entire application or major feature is no longer usable
 - The bug is causing a measurable loss of conversions through an application
 - An internal employee is no longer able to do their work

## Requesting a feature

Our software grows by adding new features or enhancements. We value the input of any employee, and everyone is encouraged to submit their ideas and feedback. Though every feature requested cannot be built, it will be discussed and considered to enter the development path.

When submitting a feature request, include as much detail as possible. Assume no one has ever thought of this feature before, and you're explaining it for the first time. The development team also operates well with user stories, that outline a behavior and an outcome. For example:

> As a customer, when I click the "Subscribe" button, I am brought to a form to enter my subscription info.
> As a customer, when I submit the subscription form, I am subscribed to a monthly newsletter.
