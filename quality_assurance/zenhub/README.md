# Using ZenHub with GitHub

## How to access the issue board

First, you may need to install the [ZenHub Chrome Extension][0] and refresh this page. On the right, you will see the "Boards" icon. It looks like this: ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/519171/6716630/28a69e20-cd7d-11e4-925d-2f9ff455b511.png)

> **Tip:** You can also press <kbd>b</kbd> on your keyboard to access the ZenHub board.

 
## How do I file an issue?

Simply visit the issues board and click "New Issue" in the top right. 

## What are these boards?

They are simply ways to organize issues. Each vertical column represents a different stage in resolving an issue. Issues move from left to right until completion.

## How does an issue work?

You post the information needed to get a job done. Then, other people can collaborate, adding comments and asking questions if needed. People can be assigned to issues to be held accountable for their completion. Once an issue is completed, it should be closed (green button at the bottom of the issue) so we know that it's done. 
 
## How do I create labels?

Labels are great for organizing issues and help everyone find things quickly. They're also good for grouping issues together that might be for the same project. For example, you may want to make a label called `[Project] Mother's Day Campaign` and put that label on all issues related to that campaign. 

 - Go to "Issues" on the right, the icon looks like this: ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/519171/6717100/86bca4de-cd80-11e4-84b0-2cb7271bd183.png)
